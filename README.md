# OpenAlti-LED-Skydiving-Altimeter
This is an open-source version of the ColorAlti skydiving altimeter. This device features a barometric pressure sensing altimeter for determining altitude, 
and 3 2020-sized neopixels for relaying altitude information to the skydiver. This project is still early in its design phase, so this readme will be fleshed
out with much more information including build instructions eventually. This product will never be for sale, but the plans & firmware will always be free.
